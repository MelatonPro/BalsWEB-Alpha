# How to download and use (Windows 11)

(This was only tested on Windows 11. May be usable on Windows 10 or earlier)

In order to download, make sure you have Python 3.13 installed from the Microsoft Store or their website.

1. Open the app on your computer, "Command Prompt". (Click search and type "Command Prompt" or "cmd" and click enter)

2. Then type: pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine

3. Afterwards, download any update.py file and open it.

The second thing that pops up whenever you open the file is the browser logs and is mainly for the developer(s) to see if the browser is crashing or malfunctioning.

You now have access to BalsWEB Alpha Build 1! Thanks for downloading!
